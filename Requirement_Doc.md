# Software Requirement Specification

This specification document describes the capabilities that will be provided by the software application **“Qualcomm Attendance System”**.

## Introduction

Qualcomm introduced a new policy to make its employee work more from office starting from January 2025. A company-wide attendance system was started to monitor employee on-site presence. However, the data regarding the attendance is not avaliable to the employees. An application is required which can tract an individual employees progress and report the attendance percentage similar to the one calculated by Qualcomm. 

### Product Scope

The software developed will be used by an individual employee, who will enter their offline presence for a particular period. The software then should calculate the attendance metric nicknamed "Qattend". 

## External User Requirment

The application will have a single interface for the user. The main purpose of this interface is for the user to enter his/her onsite presence and other characteristics of a particular workday. The same interface(phone application/desktop application/web application) can be used to show the calculated Qattend values and allow user to monitor it with various parameter described below.

The application should not allow the user to edit the storage directly, this could manipulate the reuslts which is not required.
